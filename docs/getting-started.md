- Open the menu in the top-right of Node-RED
- Click "Manage Palette"
- Switch to the "Install" tab
- Search `node-red-dashboard`
- Install the `@flowforge/node-red-dashboard` package (not `node-red-dashboard`)

The nodes will then be available in your editor for you to get started.

If you want to use `npm` to install your nodes, you can instead [follow these instructions](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/adding-nodes)

## Contributing

If you would like to run this set of nodes locally, and specifically to help contribute to the development efforts, you can read the [Contributing](./contributing/index.md) documentation.
