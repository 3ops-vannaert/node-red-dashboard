# Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Welcome to the documentation for the Node-RED Dashboard 2.0, the successor to the original, and very popular, [Node-RED Dashboard](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard).

This project was formed by [FlowForge](https://flowforge.com/), as part of efforts to upgrade the original Dashboard to steer away from Angular v1.0 which has long been deprecated. You can read our full statement about _why_ we're building Dashboard 2.0 [here](https://flowforge.com/blog/2023/06/dashboard-announcement/).
