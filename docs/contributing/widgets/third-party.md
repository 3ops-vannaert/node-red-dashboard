# Building Third Party Widgets

If you have an idea for a widget that you'd like to build in Dashboard 2.0 we are open to Pull Requests and ideas for additions to the [core collection](../../nodes/widgets.md) of Widgets.

We do also realise though that there are many occassions where a standalone repository/package works better as was very popular in Dashboard 1.0.

## Basic Folder Structure

The following explanation of how to build your own third party widgets will reference the Example Node that we've open sourced, showing various integration examples of features available.

As with any Node-RED nodes, you'll need to start with two files:

- `/nodes/ui-example.html` - defines the nodeâ€™s properties, edit dialog and help text.
- `/nodes/ui-example.js` - defines the node's server-side behaviours

Each Widget in Dashboard also consists of a `.vue` file to define how a widget is rendered in the Dashboard front-end.

- `/ui/UIExample.vue` - Defines the contents the `<template>` of a Vue component

Finally, any functions that you want to define, that will run as part of your client-side Vue component, can be defined in a standalone module.

- `/ui/methods.js` - Defines a collection of client-side Vue/JS functions.

## Registering your Widget

The core concept that Dashboard is built upon is a `.register()` function (see [docs](../../nodes/config/ui-base.md#registration)). This function is available to any `ui-base`, `ui-page` or `ui-group`. It brokers the function up to the `ui-base` where a store is maintained of all widgets in the Dashboard.

Your widget should define one of these as a property in your Node-RED node, most likely, it'll be `ui-group`, as your widget would render _inside_ a Group in the Dashboard.

In your `/nodes/ui-example.js` file:

```js
module.exports = function(RED) {
    function UIExampleNode(config) {
        RED.nodes.createNode(this, config);
        var node = this;

        // which group are we rendering this widget
        const group = RED.nodes.getNode(config.group)

        config.type = 'ui-example'     // provide a relevant widget type 
        config.templateScope = 'local' // required by ui-template

        /**
         * Further config & setup to go here
         */

        group.register(node, config, evts)
    }
    RED.nodes.registerType("ui-example", UIExampleNode);
}
```

## Configuring your Widget

A quick summary of the `config.` parameters available is as follows:

### Essential Config Options:

You must choose _one_ of these properties to include such that your Widget has a direct owner. Whichever you choose, you'll then use that owner's `.register()` function to register your widget.

You must expose this option in your node's `.html` file too so that users can define which instance (of `ui-group`, `ui-page`, `ui-base`) your widget will be bound to.

|property |  description |
|--|--|
| `group`  | The most common use case, where your widget will render as part of a Group in the Dashboard. |
| `page`   | If your widget should be constrained to a full/single page, then this is appropriate. |
| `base`   | If your widget performs independant of any page/group, then bind it to the `ui-base`. |

The following properties should then _all_ be defined, and can be done so in your node's `.js` file constructor.

|property | example | description |
|--|--|--|
| `type`           | `ui-example`   | A suitable, lowercase, kebab-case type for your widget |
| `templateScope`  | `local`        | Required by `ui-template` that all third=party widgets extend |
| `format`         | `<p>Hello</p>` | A string of HTML to render for your widget |

### Optional Config Options:

|property | description |
|--|--|
| `onMounted`       | Stringified function to run when your widget loads in Dashboard. |
| `onInput`         | Stringified function that will run client-side, whenever your node receives an input in Node-RED. |
| `methods`         | An object, where each key is the method name, and the value is a stringified function. These methods will then be exposed to your widget via the widgets's Vue component. |


## Example Configurations

Here, we go into detail about how to define the various config options available to you.
### Defining HTML to Render

The `ui-template` (which your third-party widget will extend) relies on a `format` property to define the relevant HTML to render, as a result, we can inject our own content with something like:


```js
fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, '../ui', 'UIExample.vue'), 'utf8', (err, html) => {
    config.format = html
})
```

This will read our `UIExample.vue` as a string, and then bind it to the node.

### Defining `onInput` Functionality

In the Example node we've built, we store our JS functions in a standalone `.js` file. Within this, we've defined an `onInput(msg)` function that we can pass to our config.

The contents of `onInput` are written as if contained within a `.vue` file, this means that you can use `this` freely and access any relevant `data`, `props` or `methods` as you wish, e.g:

```js
function onInput (msg) {
    // because this will get evaluated client-side, we have access to vue/this
    const vue = this
    // call Dashboard's built-in .send() function
    vue.send({
        payload: 'Created onInput'
    })
}
```

In our `ui-example.js` file, we can append this to our `config` with:

```js
// import our client-side functions
const methods = require('../ui/methods')

// methods that will be available to the widget in the Dashboard
config.onInput = methods.onInput.toString()
```

Note that we need to run `.toString()` in order for us to be able to transport this data via SocketIO to the Dashboard.

### Custom Functionality

We can extend VueJS's [methods](https://vuejs.org/api/options-state.html#methods) by using `config.methods`:

```js
// methods that will be available to the widget in the Dashboard
config.methods = {
    test: methods.test.toString()
}
```

Again, note that we need are running `.toString()` again, in order for us to be able to transport this data via SocketIO to the Dashboard.

These functions can be called directly from your `.vue` file too, e.g:

```vue
<p @click="test()">
    This is a 3rd Party Widget
</p>
```

As with the [Defining onInput Functionality](#defining-oninput-functionality) you also have access to the full `vue` object, e.g:

```js
function test () {
    // because this will get evaluated client-side, we have access to vue/this
    const vue = this
    
    // log the Widget's ID & name
    console.log(this.id, this.props.name)
}
```

## UI Template Functionality

Because we wrap third party widgets in a `ui-template` node, you have access to the same properties & functions.

### Properties

- `id` - The Widget's ID, assigned by Node-RED
- `props` - Properties defined in Node-RED, e.g. `this.props.name` or `this.props.group`

For example, we could loop over all properties and render their respective property key:

```vue
<h1>Widget ID: {{ id }}</h1>
<ul>
    <li v-for="(value, key, index) in props">
        <label>{{ key }}</label>
    </li>
</ul>
```

### Functions

- `send` - Send a `msg` (defined by the input to this function call) from this node in the Node-RED flow.

Let's consider:

```vue
<p @click="send({'payload': 'Hello World'})">
    This is a 3rd Party Widget
</p>
```

This, when clicked, will send a `msg` in Node-RED to any nodes connected to the output of this node.

## Custom SocketIO Events

It is also possible to extend our own [Events Framework](../guides/events.md) with your own events traffic, sending events from the Dashboard UI back into your node.

Definition needs to happen in two places:

- Client - where you need to `emit` the event
- Node-RED - where you need to listen to those events, and define appropriate handlers

### Emit from Dashboard

You can `emit` an event from within any of your [Custom Functionality](#custom-functionality) using the in-built `vue.$socket.emit()` function, e.g:

```js
// emit 'my-custom-event' with a topic of the widget's id, and msg of { payload: "Test" } 
vue.$socket.emit('my-custom-event', this.id, {
    payload: "Test"
})
```

### Handle Event in Node-RED

The event handlers can be added to our `evts` object passed into the `.register` function, like so:


```js
const evts = {
    onSocket: {
        'my-custom-event': function (id, msg) {
            console.log('my-custom-event', id, msg)
        }
    }
}
group.register(node, config, evts)
```
