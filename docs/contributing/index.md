# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome for Dashboard 2.0. We have a lot of great ideas we want to get built, and we'd love to have your help!
## Installing Locally

You can `git clone` this repository, and then `npm install` this from within the `./node-red` directory on your machine

The Dashboard nodes requires a static build/output from the collection of Vue components. as such,
when making local changes there is currently a manual step required to get your latest changes into the UI deployed by Node-RED:

```bash
npm run build
```

After doing so, a refresh of the UI generated by Node-RED will include any new changes.

## Adding New Widgets

When adding a new widget, you will need to follow the steps below to ensure that the widget is available in the Node-RED editor and renders correctly in the UI.

### Checklist

1. In `/nodes/`:
    - Add `<widget>.html`
    - Add `<widget>.js`
    - Add the in the `node-red/nodes` section in `package.json`
2. In `/ui/`:
    - Add `widgets/<widget>/<widget>.vue`
    - Add widget to the `index.js` file in `/ui/widgets`
