# Dashboard Planning Repository

This repository is a collaborative space for ideation, and planning of a FlowForge Node-RED Dashboard (naming open)

## Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to collect ideas, requirements, and suggestions for the FlowForge Dashboard.
Currently, the repository does not contain any actual code or implementation details. Rather, it serves as a platform for refining the concept of a FlowForge Dashboard, including:

Possible features and functionalities
Manufacturing focus
Integration with other systems or tools
Any other ideas or suggestions that could enhance the dashboard

## Decision-making Process
An important aspect of this repository is to facilitate the decision-making process itself. The decision to develop the FlowForge Dashboard is not set! This planning will help to determine whether such a project is viable, necessary, and valuable.
