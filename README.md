# Node-RED Dashboard 2.0

Welcome to the Node-RED Dashboard 2.0 repository. This repository is currently under construction, but we are working diligently to bring you a modern, interactive data visualization and dashboard solution for Node-RED.

## Motivation

The Node-RED Dashboard has served us well for many years, providing an intuitive way to create live dashboards for Node-RED flows. However, the original Dashboard is based on Angular v1, which is no longer actively maintained. We identified the need for a secure, updated, and innovative successor. Hence, we are embarking on this journey.

## Solution

The new Node-RED Dashboard will be published as a separate package. It will carry the legacy forward, adapting to future needs while keeping the essence of open-source and community-driven development intact. The project will be licensed under Apache 2.0.

## Community and Contribution

We strongly believe in the power of community. If you have suggestions, feedback, or features you'd like to see, please open a [Github issue](https://github.com/flowforge/flowforge-nr-dashboard/issues/new/choose). We also highly encourage open-source contributions. We aim to create a robust tool through community collaboration.

## Join Us

We're looking for a freelancer to assist in the development of the first version of the new dashboard. This 2-3 month project offers an opportunity to shape the future of data visualization and Node-RED. Interested? [Contact us](https://boards.greenhouse.io/flowforge).

## Vision

We are excited about the potential of this project. The journey is filled with challenges, but with the support of the community and a dedicated team, we're confident in creating a tool that surpasses its predecessor.

Join us on this journey as we redefine the future of data visualization with the new Node-RED Dashboard.
