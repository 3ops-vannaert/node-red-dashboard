    <p>
        Tracks client-side events in the Node-RED Dashboard, and reports them into the Node-RED Editor.
    </p>
    <p>
        This widget doesn't render any content into your Dashboard. Instead, it listens for user-driven behaviour and events in your Dashboard and emits accordingly into the Node-RED Editor when those events have taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
        Current, supported events are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>$pageview</b> - Emits whenever a user views a page.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>$pageleave</b> - Emits whenever a user leaves a page.
        </li>
    </ul>
</script>
